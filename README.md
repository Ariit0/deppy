# deppy

Small CLI tool that parses dependency file into csv format.

Currently only supports node projects.

## TODO

- Allow for setup of csv columns - for now this is hard coded
- Allow for setting of notes/comments on a per dep basis
- Identity the language used for the dependency
- Parse dependencies of dependencies (specify dependency tree depth)
- And more...
